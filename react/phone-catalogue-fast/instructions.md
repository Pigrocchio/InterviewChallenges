# Phone Catalogue
Your task is to write a very simple product catalogue app.

All you have to do is create a Fake Api that is consumed from the front. It must not have persistence, therefore it is not necessary that you do a backend

1. Write a React app that displays the phones from the Fake API
- Display an initial list with all phones
- When a phone model is selected from the list, it will render a phone detail view displaying a few more details about that phone
- Display a spinner or placeholder component while the API request is ongoing
- Make it look decent. No need for super sophisticated design, but at a minimum, make it somewhat responsive so that it doesnâ€™t look terrible on a mobile phone. Add images for each device.
2. Push the code to a public github repo with a README.md that explains how to run API & Frontend app

## Bonus points
1. Write realistic unit/end-to-end tests.
